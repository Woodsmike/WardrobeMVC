Create a web application for managing the contents of your wardrobe. The app will allow you to add, edit, view, and delete items in your closet.
Skills Required
Database First MVC Tasks
Organization of clothing by type
•	Tops
•	Bottoms
•	Shoes Accessories Model(s) must include the following properties
•	ID
•	Name
•	Photo
•	Type
•	Color

•	Tops
•	Bottoms
•	Shoes
•	Accessories
•	Photo properly included where appropriate (index/detail)
•	Homepage should be updated for your app Bootstrap/CSS
•	Updated navbar
•	Thumbnails At least 1 other Bootstrap component of your choice Responsive layout (using Bootstrap grid) Customize styling for all index and details pages Generate script for database (schema and data) Details
Design an app that will let you manage the contents of your closet. It should support several different types of clothing stored in your database:
•	Tops
•	Bottoms
•	Shoes
•	Accessories Whether or not you store these as separate tables or a single table is up to you. You will need to have views that allow the user to focus on clothing by type, so keep that in mind when making your decision.
Each item of clothing will need to have the following properties kept with it:
•	ID
•	Name
•	Photo
•	Type
•	Color
•	Season
•	Occasion You need to determine the appropriate columns/constraints to use for all fields.
You should customize all of your views to develop the best user experience you can manage. Show photos when appropriate, but don't have them get in the way. Use Bootstrap effectively to make the app responsive for both desktops and mobile devices. Add your own styles to make it a little less "bootstrappy".
Stretch Tasks
A natural progression of this app is to support the creation of outfits - a collection of coordinating tops/bottoms/shoes/accessories. Build this into your model, and create views for working with outfits.
Ultimately, your views should be integrated, so you can see all the pictures of each item per outfit.
